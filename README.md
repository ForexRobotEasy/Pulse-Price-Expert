## Global Variables

- `StopLoss` - Default Stop Loss level
- `TakeProfit` - Default Take Profit level
- `MaxRisk` - Default maximum risk per trade in percentage

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. In this function, the stop loss, take profit, and maximum risk per trade are set to their default values. The values are then normalized based on the number of digits in the currency pair.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. This function is responsible for performing any necessary cleanup tasks.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. In this function, market data analysis, indicator integration, strategy generation, and real-time trading execution logic can be implemented. 

As an example, this code opens a buy trade with the specified stop loss and take profit levels. The current ask price is used to calculate the stop loss and take profit levels. If the order is successfully opened, a message is printed with the ticket number. Otherwise, an error message is printed with the error code.

## Start Function

The `OnStart()` function is called when the expert advisor starts. Any necessary tasks to be performed when the expert advisor starts can be added in this function.

## Custom Functions

Custom functions for market analysis, indicator integration, strategy generation, and more can be added in this section.
